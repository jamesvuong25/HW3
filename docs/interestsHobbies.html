                Movies are one of my biggest interests. They're a great way to relax, be entertained, and hang out with 
                other people. Click on the image to see my favorite movies!

                Watching cooking videos is another one of my interests. I don't exactly try new recipes, but it's relaxing
                to watch. Click on the image below to see my favorite cooking videos!

            <li>
                Basketball is my favorite sport to watch and play. I think it's a great way to exercise and meet other people.

            <li>
                Soccer is one of my newer interests. I think it's more fun to play than watch. Click on the image below to visit the Gonzaga Women's Soccer team page!
